# Module-3
# 🧹 Strings-Remove Nth Index Character from a String

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that accepts a string and removes the character at a specified index.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a function named `remove` that takes the input string as an argument.
2. Receive input string s.
3. Slice the string into two parts
8. Print new.

## 💻 Program
```
def remove(s):
    new=s[:3]+s[3+1:]
    print(new)
```

## Output
